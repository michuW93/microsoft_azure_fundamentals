# Spear phishing
Spear phishing is like phising but targeted. Spear phishing is an email or electronic communications scam <b>targeted towards a specific individual, organization or business</b>. Often intended to steal data for malicious purposes. </br>
This is how it works: <b>An email arrives, apparently from a trustworthy source, but instead it leads the unknowing recipient to a bogus website full of malware (or website with login page which looks exactly the same as real website e.g Facebook)</b>. These emails often use clever tactics to get victims' attention. For example, the FBI has warned of spear phishing scams where the emails appeared to be from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

# Dictionary attack - brute force attack
A dictionary attack is a method of breaking into a password-protected computer, network or other IT resource by <b>systematically entering every word in a dictionary as a password</b>. A dictionary attack can also be used in an attempt to find the key necessary to decrypt an encrypted message or document.

# password spraying
Password Spraying is a variant of what is known as a brute force attack. In a traditional brute force attack, the perpetrator attempts to gain unauthorized access to a single account by guessing the password repeatedly in a very short period of time. Most organizations have employed countermeasures, commonly a lock-out after three to five attempts. In a Password Spraying attack, the attacker circumvents common countermeasures (e.g., account lock out) by “spraying” the same password across many accounts before trying another password. <b>so here instead of using milions of passwords for single account we try small batch of passwords for multiple accounts</b>
