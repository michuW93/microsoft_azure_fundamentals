Spear phishing is like phising but targeted. Spear phishing is an email or electronic communications scam <b>targeted towards a specific individual, organization or business</b>. Often intended to steal data for malicious purposes. </br>
This is how it works: <b>An email arrives, apparently from a trustworthy source, but instead it leads the unknowing recipient to a bogus website full of malware (or website with login page which looks exactly the same as real website e.g Facebook)</b>. These emails often use clever tactics to get victims' attention. For example, the FBI has warned of spear phishing scams where the emails appeared to be from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
