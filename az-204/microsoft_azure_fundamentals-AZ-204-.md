Tutorial based on Matthew Kruczek videos

# Develop Azure Compute Solutions:
* Implement IaaS Solutions (Provision Virtual Machines but you need to take care of rest, Configure, validate and deploy ARM templates, Configure container images for solutions, publish an image to the Azure Container Registry, Run Containers by using Azure Container Instance)
* Create Azure App Service Web Apps (Create an Azure App Service Web App, enable diagnostic logging, deploy code to a web app, configure web app settings, implement autoscaling rules, including scheduled autoscaling and scaling by operational or system metrics)
* Implement Azure Functions (create and deploy Azure Functions, Implement input and output bindings for a function, implement function triggers by using data operations, timers and webhooks, implement azure durable functions, implement custom handlers)

# Implement Azure security
* Implement user authentication and authorization (authenticate and authorize users and apps by using Azure Active Directory, create and implement shared access signatures)
* implement secure cloud solutions (Azure services which deals with security: Azure Key Vault, Microsoft Graph)

# Connect to and Consume Azure Services and Third-party Services
* Implement API Management (Create an APIM instance, configure authentications for APIs, Define policies for APIs)
* Develop Event-Based Solutions (Implement solutions that use Azure Event Grid and Azure Event Hub)
* Develop Message-Based Solutions (Implement solutions that use Azure Service Bus and Azure Queue Storage Queues)

# Develop for Azure Storage
* Develop Solutions that use Cosmos DB storage(Select the appropriate API and SDK for solution, implement partitioning schemes and partition keys, perform operations on data and Cosmos DB containers, set the appropriate consistency level for opertations, manage change feed notifications)

# Monitor, Troubleshoot and optimize azure solutions
* Integrate caching and content delivery within solutions (Configure cache and expiration policies for Azure Redis cache, Implement data sizing, connections, encryption and expiration)
* instrument solutions to support monitoring and logging (configure an app to use Application Insights, analyze and troubleshoot solutions by using Azure Monitor, Implement Application Insights web tests and alerts)
