What is AI?
Simply put, AI is the creation of software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities. Key workloads include:

* Machine learning - This is often the foundation for an AI system, and is the way we "teach" a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data.
* Anomaly detection - The capability to automatically detect errors or unusual activity in a system.
* Computer vision - The capability of software to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images.
* Natural language processing - The capability for a computer to interpret written or spoken language, and respond in kind.
* Knowledge mining - The capability to extract information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store.
