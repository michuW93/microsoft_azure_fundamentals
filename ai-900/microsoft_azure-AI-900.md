What is AI?
Simply put, AI is the creation of software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities. Key workloads include:

* Machine learning - This is often the foundation for an AI system, and is the way we "teach" a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data.
* Anomaly detection - The capability to automatically detect errors or unusual activity in a system.
* Computer vision - The capability of software to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images.
* Natural language processing - The capability for a computer to interpret written or spoken language, and respond in kind.
* Knowledge mining - The capability to extract information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store.

Anomaly detection:
1. Sensors in the car collect telemetry, such as engine revolutions, brake temperature, and so on.
2. An anomaly detection model is trained to understand expected fluctuations in the telemetry measurements over time.
3. If a measurement occurs outside of the normal expected range, the model reports an anomaly that can be used to alert the race engineer to call the driver in for a pit stop to fix the issue before it forces retirement from the race.

Computer vision - is a field of computer science that focuses on enabling computers to identify and understand objects and people in **images and videos**. Like other types of AI, computer vision seeks to perform and automate tasks that replicate human capabilities. Type of computer vision: face detection, optical character recognation etc.

Natural language processing (NLP) is the area of AI that deals with creating software that understands written and spoken language. <br>
NLP enables you to create software that can:
Analyze and interpret text in documents, email messages, and other sources.
Interpret spoken language, and synthesize speech responses.
Automatically translate spoken or written phrases between languages.
Interpret commands and determine appropriate actions.
